# Virtual-Pet-game
The virtual pet game lets you adopt from one of three species —lizard, cat,  or puppy. Each starts with distinct health, happiness, and hunger levels. You can name your pet and take care of  them using Feed, Play, and Heal commands. The commands have distinct effects on different species. Neglect or overfeeding can cause a pet to leave home. 



   After six cycles, if your pet’s health remains at least 80% of its initial value, you’re given a choice of whether or not to adopt a second pet. Two pets of the same species (except lizards) enjoy slower health decline and happiness decay but grow hungry faster. Lizards must always be raised alone, so raising two lizards have no differences with raising one.
