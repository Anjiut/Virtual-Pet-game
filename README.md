# Virtual-Pet-game
The virtual pet game lets you adopt from one of three species —lizard, cat,  or puppy. Each starts with distinct health, happiness, and hunger levels. You can name your pet and take care of  them using Feed, Play, and Heal commands. The commands have distinct effects on different species. Neglect or overfeeding can cause a pet to leave home. 



   After six cycles, if your pet’s health remains at least 80% of its initial value, you’re given a choice of whether or not to adopt a second pet. Two pets of the same species (except lizards) enjoy slower health decline and happiness decay but grow hungry faster. Lizards must always be raised alone, so raising two lizards have no differences with raising one.

    Target Audience : The Virtual Pet Game is designed for individuals who love animals and dream of having a pet, but may not be able to care for a real one due to practical constraints. This includes people with busy lifestyles, limited living space, or unpredictable schedules that make traditional pet ownership challenging. It also appeals to those who are unsure about their ability to care for a real pet and want to explore the responsibility in a low-risk, digital environment.
